# Income Level Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the income level (<=50K or >50K) of individuals based on various demographic attributes using a machine learning model.

## Project Overview
The project involves:
- Data preprocessing, including label encoding and one-hot encoding for categorical variables.
- Model training using a Random Forest Classifier.
- Model evaluation through accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- Visualization of the normalized confusion matrix.

## Installation and Requirements
Ensure the following libraries are installed:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
